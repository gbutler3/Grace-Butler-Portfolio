Given a single-page application portfolio for a web developer

- When I load the portfolio I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
- When I view the header, I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
- When I view the navigation titles I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
- When I click on a navigation title I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
- When I load the portfolio the first time the 'About Me' title and section are selected by default
- When I am presented with the 'About Me' section I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
- When I am presented with the Portfolio section I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories
- When I am presented with the Contact section I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
